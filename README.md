The Backtracking Algorithm
The Backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving technique that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions of a problem and abandons a candidate (“backtracks”) as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution12. Key Concepts: Incremental Construction: The algorithm builds solutions piece by piece, one step at a time. Backtracking: If a partial solution is found to be invalid, the algorithm backtracks to the previous step and tries a different path. Depth-First Search: It typically uses a depth-first search approach to explore all possible solutions. Applications: Constraint Satisfaction Problems: Such as crosswords, Sudoku, and the N-Queens problem. Combinatorial Optimization: Problems like the knapsack problem and Hamiltonian paths. Parsing: Used in some programming languages and compilers. Example: A classic example is the N-Queens problem, where the goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The algorithm places queens one by one in different columns, and if a placement leads to a conflict, it backtracks and tries the next position
